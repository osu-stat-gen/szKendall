\title{Simulated count data from Sim3 setting}
\format{
A simulated count matrix with 1830 rows and 150 columns:
\describe{
Each row corresponds to one locus pair. The 61 loci result in 61*60/2 = 1830 locus pairs.
Each column corresponds to one single cell. There are 3 subtypes, each contains 50 cells, resulting in 150 cells.
}
}
\source{
These subtypes are derived based on the 3D structure of a segment in chromosome 19 (61 loci) from a K562 cell (accession: GSM2109974) obtained from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE80006. The parameter setting is: alpha_0=1.8, gamma=0.6, eta=0.1, tau1=0.3, tau2=0.6.
}
\usage{
sim3.data
}
\description{
This dataset contains simulated single-cell Hi-C data used to demonstrate the functionality
of the szKendall functions. It consists of 150 single cells of 3 subtypes (each with 50 cells).
