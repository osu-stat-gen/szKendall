\title{Expected mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) chromosome 1 data}
\format{
A count matrix with 19503 rows and 42 columns:
\describe{
Each row corresponds to one locus pair. The 198 loci result in 198*197/2 = 19503 locus pairs.
Each column corresponds to one single cell. There are 42 cells: 30 cells in G1 phase, 4 cells in early-S phase, and 8 cells in late-S/G2 phase.
}
}
\source{
The expected count data was obtained by smoothing the observed count data. See szKendall manuscript for details.
}
\usage{
mESC.true.data
}
\description{
This dataset contains the expected count ("true") mESC single-cell Hi-C data for 42 cells. The cells are at three different cell-cycle phases (G1, early-S, late-S/G2) --- see mESC.cell.type.
