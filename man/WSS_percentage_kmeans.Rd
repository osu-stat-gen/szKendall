\title{Calculate the within-cluster sum of squares percentage (WSS\%)}
\usage{
WSS_percentage_kmeans(kmeans_object)
}
\arguments{
\item{kmeans_object}{An object of class "\code{kmeans}", which is returned by the \code{kmeans()} function.}
}
\value{
A numeric value of WSS\%, between 0 and 1.
}
\description{
This function computes the within-cluster sum of squares percentage (WSS\%), given the K-means clustering result.
