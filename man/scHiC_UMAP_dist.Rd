\title{UMAP 2D projection of a dissimilarity matrix}
\usage{
scHiC_UMAP_dist(
  data,
  cell_type,
  seed = 1234,
  main = "",
  clustering = "KMHW",
  ncenters = 3,
  show.legend = TRUE,
  alpha_value = 1
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{An \code{n_single}x\code{n_single} symmetric dissimilarity matrix.}

\item{cell_type}{A vector of length \code{n_single} indicating the true cell (sub)type each cell belongs to.}

\item{seed}{An integer of random seed value. It is recommended to set random seed to ensure reproducibility. Default value is 1234.}

\item{main}{The title given to the output plot. Default is empty ("").}

\item{clustering}{A character indicating whether/which type of clustering is performed on the projected space.
\describe{
\item{"KMHW"}{Perform K-means (Hartigan-Wong) clustering. This is the default value. }
\item{"KML"}{Perform K-means (Lloyd) clustering.}
\item{"KMMQ"}{Perform K-means (MacQueen) clustering.}
\item{"pam"}{Perform PAM (Partitioning Around Medoids) clustering.}
\item{"hierarchical"}{Perform hierarchical clustering.}
\item{NULL}{No clustering is performed on the projected space.}
}}

\item{ncenters}{An integer specifying the number of clusters. Default is 3. If \code{clustering = NULL}, then the value of \code{ncenters} is ignored.}

\item{show.legend}{A logical value about whether legend is present. Default value is TRUE.}

\item{alpha_value}{A numeric value ranges from 0 to 1, with lower values corresponding to more transparent colors for the points. Default value is 1.}
}
\value{
A plot that visualizes each cell as a point in the 2D space. If clustering is performed on the projected space, the shape of a point represents the cluster a single cell belongs to, and the color represents the true cell (sub)type (\code{cell_type}). If clustering is not performed on the projected space (\code{clustering=NULL}), both point shape and point color represent the true cell (sub)type.
}
\description{
This function projects a dissimilarity matrix into the two-dimensional (2D) space through UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection).
