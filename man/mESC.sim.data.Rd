\title{Observed mouse Embryonic Stem Cell (mESC) chromosome 1 data}
\format{
A count matrix with 19503 rows and 42 columns:
\describe{
Each row corresponds to one locus pair. The 198 loci result in 198*197/2 = 19503 locus pairs.
Each column corresponds to one single cell. There are 42 cells: 30 cells in G1 phase, 4 cells in early-S phase, and 8 cells in late-S/G2 phase.
}
}
\source{
The observed data was processed by scHi-CSim (Fan et al., 2023) (https://github.com/zhanglabtools/scHi-CSim/tree/main/data, with GEO accession: GSE94489).
}
\usage{
mESC.sim.data
}
\description{
This dataset contains the observed mESC single-cell Hi-C data for 42 cells. The cells are at three different cell-cycle phases (G1, early-S, late-S/G2) --- see mESC.cell.type.
