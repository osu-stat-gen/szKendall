\title{kendall
Kendall's tau matrix for loci pair (i,j) in single cell 1 and loci pair (u,v) in single cell 2 for all (i,j) and (u,v)}
\usage{
kendall(Y1, Y2)
}
\arguments{
\item{Y1}{The observed contact counts for single cell 1}

\item{Y2}{The observed contact counts for single cell 2}
}
\value{
An NxN square matrix of the Kendall's tau values (0, 1, or 0.5), where N is the number of loci in the single cells (i.e., the length of Y1 and Y2)
